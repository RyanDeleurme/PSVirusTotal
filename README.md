# PSVirusTotal
Powershell wrapper for the VirusTotal API

## To Install
To install the commands, just clone the repo to c:\users\\%USERNAME%\Documents\WindowsPowershell\Modules\PSVirusTotal

## To Use
Once you have cloned the repo to the path above (or to any $env:PsModulePath), you can issue

``Import-Module PSVirusTotal``

## Documentation
I would recommend looking at Virus Total's api and get familiar with it. This will make the query parameters, and understanding how to use the commands easier. You can fine the docs at https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#overview
